Great Replacement Remote,"Like many others, I bought this remote because one of the buttons started failing on the original remote.  Specifically the right move on the circular button. To be honest I was skeptical  at first but I read through the review and saw many others giving it a decent review. Works just like the original. If you are having by trouble getting Bixby to work you need to resync the remote by holding the back button and the play/pause button for about three seconds. Someone mentioned that in a review and it worked for me.  So props to that reviewer!! Feels like the original and looks like the original. Only difference is the Samsung logo is not on the remote. If you want a replacement remote for your Samsung tv this is the way to go for sure!!! Happy channel surfing!!! üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üì∫

My 80yr old mother loves it... enough said!,"My 80yr old mother has a Samsung TV and eventually wore out the remote that came with it.  She came to really like the old remote.  I purchased another replacement remote for her TV and although it worked, she was not happy with it.  This remote she said was very easy to control for her.  On behalf of a grateful son, I can't recommend this enough!  BTW, I did the setup on this and the manufactures instructions on how to PAIR it were right on and it worked great!

So far it is just as good as the original,"I lost my original Samsung remote and bought this as a replacement. The price was great. The volume buttons look different. The rest looks the same. I did read some reviews about voice not working. My original did not have voice, and I am not looking for voice. The device ergonomics mimic the original (feel and operation).
